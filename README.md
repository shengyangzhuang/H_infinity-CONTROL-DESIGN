# H_infinity-CONTROL-DESIGN
This is a project assignment regarding H_infinity Control Design supervised by Prof. Dr. Elling W. Jacobsen in the KTH course, Control Theory and Practice Advanced Course.

In H ∞ control design the sensitivity and complementary sensitivity function are shaped to meet certain desired specifications. The main goal of this lab is to get a feeling for how H∞ control design can be used to obtain desired specifications on sensitivity and robustness. Note that the lab only deals with SISO systems, but that the same design principles apply to MIMO systems.
